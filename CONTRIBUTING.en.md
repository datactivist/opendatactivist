## Code Style & Pre-commit

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. The style rules are defined in the `.eslintrc` file and the formatting rules in the `.prettierrc` file.

You can run the following commands to automatically apply the styles, and check that your code conforms to the style and formatting rules:

```bash
npm run format
npm run lint:fix
npm run lint
```

Alternatively, if you are using **VSCode**, you can install the associated **ESLint** and **Prettier** extensions to get feedback directly in your editor.

> **Warning**  
> This project uses husky to ensure that the code is compliant before each commit, if `npm run lint` or `npm run test` returns errors, the commit is cancelled.
